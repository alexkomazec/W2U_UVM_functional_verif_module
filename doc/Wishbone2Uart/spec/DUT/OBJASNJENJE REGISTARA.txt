The RBR, receiver buffer register contains the byte received 
if no FIFO is used, or the oldest unread byte with FIFO's. 
If FIFO buffering is used, each new read action of the register
 will return the next byte, until no more bytes are present. 
Bit 0 in the LSR line status register can be used to check if 
all received bytes have been read. This bit wil change to 
zero if no more bytes are present.
